Tech and science nerd. I have a passion for learning new topics regarding technology, as well as expanding my skill set. I currently work as a Systems Administrator on a team that manages and supports the systems and infrastructure that are critical to energy management and transmission. I also support variety of energy management applications and write code/scripts to automate certain processes and procedures.
